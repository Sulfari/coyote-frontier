reagent-name-oxidant = oxidant
reagent-desc-oxidant = High heat capacity, low viscosity, chemically inert, corrosion preventing, electrically insulated fluid. The stuff of IPC life.

reagent-name-sylexalin = sylexalin
reagent-desc-sylexalin = Synthetic-grade circulatory stimulant designed to stop and quickly recoup Oxidant loss; at the cost of structural stability.

reagent-name-sylashizine = sylashizine
reagent-desc-sylashizine = Synthetic-grade coagulant for piercing and slashing trauma.

reagent-name-autosolder = autosolder
reagent-desc-autosolder = Synthetic-grade circulatory depressant that gives the system a chance to resist temperature shock and repair system trauma.
